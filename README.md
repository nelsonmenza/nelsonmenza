👨‍💻 **About Me**:

I'm a self-taught learner from the Dominican Republic, currently residing in the United States. With a strong foundation in IT from my high school education and hands-on experience as an electrical technician, specializing in Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), I've honed valuable troubleshooting skills and practical problem-solving expertise.

🔌 **Technical Focus**:

While initially pursuing full-stack development, I've realized my passion lies in backend development. Nonetheless, I'm committed to gaining a comprehensive understanding of how front-end development works. This journey has been an exciting exploration of both ends of the technology spectrum.

📚 **Learning and Portfolio**:

- 🌱 Currently, I'm immersed in learning the intricacies of Django, a powerful Python backend framework, as well as I'm currently in the early stages of learning SQL and JavaScript, two essential components of modern web development.
- 🛠️ This journey involves creating practical projects that not only showcase my skills but also demonstrate my passion for solving real-world problems through technology.
- ⚡ I firmly believe that continuous learning is indispensable in navigating the ever-evolving technology landscape and staying at the forefront of the field.

Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories based on my learning path, which will reflect my progress in these exciting technologies.
