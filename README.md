### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm a self-taught learner from the Dominican Republic, currently living in the United States. I made the decision to change my career path and pursue my passion as a full-stack developer.

I have a solid foundation in IT due to my high school education, which focused on information technology.

This role has provided me with valuable troubleshooting skills and practical problem-solving experience.

- :speech_balloon: While English is not my native language, I am proficient in reading, writing, and expressing myself in English. I continue to learn and improve my English skills. Spanish is my native language.

### Learning and Portfolio

- :seedling: During my free time, I am devoted to studying new concepts, solving coding problems, and building my portfolio.
- :zap: I believe that continuous learning is essential to keep up with the ever-changing technology landscape and stay ahead of the curve.
